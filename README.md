## This is a complete project
This is supposed to be an offline only front end  project,
there is no web ranking involved for analytics, at least not yet, I may continue
this project in future if I feel like it.

### See the website here https://kartik918.github.io/Vibe-music/

### Desktop recommended to view since landing page isn't responsive as of now.

I know it sucks I'll fix it someday.
